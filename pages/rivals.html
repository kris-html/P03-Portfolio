                <p> The purpose of this passion project was to depict the rivalry and opposition between two players in a tournament match
                    for the first-person shooter game Overwatch 2 by means of an illustration.
                    I was inspired by when after the match, when the broadcast for the tournament displayed an infographic between two players
                    who were playing the same character, Sombra. In this illustration I needed to depict the identities of these players, and integrate
                    their image with the design of Sombra, a technomacer with technology imbeded into her body capable of hacking with just her fingertips.
