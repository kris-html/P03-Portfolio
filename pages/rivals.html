                <p> The purpose of this passion project was to depict the rivalry and opposition between two players in
                    a tournament match for the first-person shooter game Overwatch 2 by means of an illustration.
                    I needed to express the identities of the players and integrate
                    their image with the design of the character they both play.

                <div class="analysis">
                    <p> In my inital draft sketch I wanted to include aspects of the player's team and the
                        character they play into the overall design.
                        It created a focus point where I can lead the users eyes downwards by using a spotlight originating above them.

                    <p> I worked on one of the portraits first, as jumping between the two felt inconsistant and hindered my abilities. 
                        The colour palette I selected are inspired on their team colours in order to further connect them to their team.

                    <p> I decided to ultimately remove the other player of this illustration.
                        Viewing the piece as a whole created two contrasting colours that made more of a separation between
                        the players than I wanted.

                <p> I learned a lot about composition and where to selectively use color. I feel I was able to avoid overloading the viewer 
                    with bright colors, only using the green to highlight my subject.
