            <p>I originally was going to depict this moment by drawing the in-game characters in the action of fighting each other, 
                but soon realized this would not hold the same amount of energy and emotion these teams went through. It felt too 
                generalized to any fight you may see in-game, so I decided to switch gears and sketch out what it would look like 
                if the players themselves were the characters they played, holding their weapons and wearing their armor. I wanted 
                the viewer to be able to immediately understand this was a specific moment in the series that held importance to the 
                grand finals.</p>
