    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m Kristin, a media arts student currently enrolled at Simon Fraser University. I work digitally,
        creating expressive and thoughtful illustrations with the help of my family's 7 year old iPad Pro. 
        I find inspiration through wanting to visualize and bring to life the emotional connections within the 
        subject you could only think about. My passion for video games and learning about what goes into developing new 
        concepts is what drives me forward to improve and create new original pieces. </p>

    <h2>Let's Connect!</h2>
