                <p>Josh Ralla from The Peak asked me to create the week 3 cover illustration. It was to
                    be based off the week's featured article on the Gateway Theatre's audio play that delves into
                    'Chinese traditions and festivities while
                    conjuring childhood experiences of Lunar New Year Celebrations'. Elements to be included: red and
                    gold dominant background with symbolic Lunar New Year objects.

                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>Using reference photos, I marked out compostion with the elements I was to include. It was
                        challenging to find a suitable composition
                        but since there needs to be space in the center, I thought it was best to have the elements wrap
                        around this center. This resulted in a composition that pulled your eyes to the center.

                <div class="analysis">
                    <p>Some elements I initally wanted to include had clashing colours with the overall palette, and
                        this resulted in replacing certain elements (mahjong tiles)
                        with food items that have a similar palette to the composition.

                    <p>This was the point I sent it in for review. Nothing needed to be changed so I proceeded with
                        finalizing the rendering the piece.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>To be honest I was nervous creating this piece, this is a topic close to my culture and I wanted to
                    get all the elements correct.
                    Thinking back in hindsight I think I ended up overcrowding the overall composition with all the
                    objects I wanted to include.
                    There wasn't enough breathing space and use of negative space to further enhance the
                    piece. But with how this was my first commission for a cover, I am very happy with how it turned
                    out.
