                <p>The Peak's production and design editor Josh Ralla reached out to me to create the week 3 cover illustration. This illustration 
                    is based off the featured article on the Gateway Theatre's six-episode audio play that delves into 'Chinese traditions and festivities while
                    conjuring childhood experiences of Lunar New Year Celebrations'. Josh requested some elements which included: a red and gold dominant 
                    background with symbolic Lunar New Year objects scattered throughout and images of objects specifically mentioned in the play around the bottom.

                <p>This was the check-in piece I sent to Josh for review. I wanted to get his, and the production team's opinion on any changes
                    or adjustments that could be made to my current illustration. They were satisfied with the product so far, so from here I proceeded
                    with finalizing the illustration into it's final version and sent it off to the Josh.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>To be honest I was nervous creating this piece, this is a topic close to my culture and I wanted to get all the elements correct.
                    Thinking back in hindsight I think I ended up overcrowding the overall composition with all the objects I wanted to include. 
                    There wasn't enough breathing space and use of negative space to further enhance the 
                    piece. But with how this was my first commission for a cover, I am very happy with how it turned out.
