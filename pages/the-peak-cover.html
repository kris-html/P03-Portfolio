                <p>The Peak asked me to create the week 3 cover illustration. It was to
                    be based off the featured article on the Gateway Theatre's audio play that delves into
                    'Chinese traditions and festivities while conjuring childhood experiences of Lunar New 
                    Year Celebrations'. Elements to be included: red and
                    gold dominant background with symbolic Lunar New Year objects.

                    <p>It was challenging to find a suitable composition with the elements needed,
                        but I worked with creating negative space. This resulted in a composition that pulled your eyes to the center.

                    <p>Elements I wanted to include created a muddy colour palette and 
                        resulted in replacing certain elements to better fit the intended colours.

                    <p>This was the point I sent it in for review. Nothing needed to be changed so I proceeded with

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <div class="analysis">
                <p>I learnt a lot with composition and preventing overcrowding overall composition.
                    This was done through using white space and use of negative space. I also learnt using 
                    references can help drastically creating an accurate piece.
