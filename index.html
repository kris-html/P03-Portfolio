            <p class="home-authorinfo">Kristin is a media arts student currently enrolled at Simon Fraser University. She
                works digitally,
                creating expressive and thoughtful illustrations with the help of her family's 7 year old iPad Pro.
                She finds inspiration through wanting to visualize and bring to life emotional connections within the
                subject someone could only think about. Her passion for what goes into developing new concepts is what
                drives her forward to improve and create.
